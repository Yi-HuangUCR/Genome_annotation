# Genome_annotation
The goal of this project is to annotate the genome structure of Arctostaphylos glauca and compare it with other plant species in Ericaceae family. This repository contains the scripts I have used to identify repetitive elments, annotate genes (using both MAKER and Funannotate pipeline), and conduct a synteny anlysis to compare this genome with other genome plants. This project has been presented in Botany 2021 conference, and the slides for the presentation is available in this repository.
